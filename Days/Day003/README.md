#  Display Windows

Use the [openWindow](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/openwindow) SwiftUI Environment value to open new windows in VisionOS.

Each window type needs to be defined in the App's main Scene. Each window type can be opened an "unlimited" number of times.

This [video on creating 2D windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_V19d_sdOw) is a solid crash course.
